An android app with very simple UI to read aloud the text scanned by the camera in the app

It would be specifically useful for visually impaired because the app has only one button making it easy to use. The button when clicked starts the camera to click a picture of the text it is aimed at.  

Once the picture is clicked, the app reads the text aloud.  
It works offline.
